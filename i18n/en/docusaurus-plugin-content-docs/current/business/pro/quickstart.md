# Quick Start

Almost the same as the community version's [Quick Start](../../beginner/quickstart.md), this document only introduces the differences.

## Installation

- Extract hybridclr_unity and place it in the project's Packages directory, rename it to com.code-philosophy.hybridclr
- Extract the corresponding `il2cpp_plus-{version}.zip` according to your Unity version
- Extract `hybridclr.zip`
- Place the hybridclr directory from the extracted `hybridclr.zip` into the libil2cpp directory from the extracted `il2cpp-{version}.zip`
- Open `HybridCLR/Installer`, enable the `Copy libil2cpp from local` option, select the libil2cpp directory you just extracted, and perform the installation
