# Introduction

The Professional version provides advanced features not supported by the community version, suitable for scenarios with high memory and package size requirements or **certain performance pressure**, such as WebGL games.

## Advantages

- Supports [Full Generic Sharing](../fullgenericsharing) technology, no longer requiring supplemental metadata
- Includes [Metadata Optimization](../metadataoptimization) technology, significantly optimizing metadata memory
- Includes **[Standard Interpretation Optimization](../basicencryption)**, greatly improving interpretation performance. Taking numerical computation instructions as an example, performance has made a qualitative leap after using standard interpretation optimization technology, achieving **280%-735%** of the original performance! The performance of some special codes like typeof instructions has improved by more than 1000%.
- Supports [Hotfix Dynamic Hot Repair](../hotfix) technology
- Supports code encryption for better security
- Includes one year of technical support

## Supported Versions

Supports all Unity 2019-6000 LTS versions.
