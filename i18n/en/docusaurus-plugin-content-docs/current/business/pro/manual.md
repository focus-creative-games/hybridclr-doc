## Installation

:::tip

Since version v8.6.0, the libil2cpp directory has been included in the com.code-philosophy.hybridclr package.

:::

- After extracting `pro-{version}`, place the `com.code-philosophy.hybridclr` folder into your project’s **Packages** directory.
- Open **HybridCLR/Installer**, then click **Install** — this will automatically copy **libil2cpp** from the `Data~/libil2cpp` directory and complete the installation.
