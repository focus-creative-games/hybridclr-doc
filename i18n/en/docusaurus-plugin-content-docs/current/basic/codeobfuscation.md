# Code Obfuscation

If the hot-update code is not obfuscated, tools like ILSpy can easily decompile it into nearly original C# code, posing a serious threat to the intellectual property and code security of commercial game projects and indie game development.

Among the currently available open-source code obfuscation tools, only [Obfuz](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/obfuz) is deeply integrated with Unity and fully supports HybridCLR.

Obfuz is an open-source, powerful, user-friendly, and stable solution for code obfuscation and reinforcement, fully meeting the needs of commercial game projects. It is highly recommended to use Obfuz to encrypt and protect your code.

Obfuz has provided the following relevant documentation:
